TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

    1. Definitions.
          * "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use,
            reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through

            to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
            contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%)
            or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
            of such entity.
          * "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
          * "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making
            modifications, including but not limited to software source code
            and example code.
          * "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
          * "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an
            example is provided in the Appendix below).
          * "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
            Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for
            which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or
            other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
            authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
            shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
            link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
            Derivative Works thereof.
          * "Embedding Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or

            the Work and Derivative Works.
          * "Applications of the Work" shall mean any work, whether in
            Source or Object form, that is expressed through the grammar
            rules which are known by the Work and that require the Work to
            perform its execution.
          * "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the
            original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
            owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
            on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
            definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
            written communication sent to the Licensor or its
            representatives, including but not limited to communication on
            electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
            tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
            but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
            otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
            Contribution."
          * "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
            Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by
            Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, prepare
       Embedding Works, prepare Applications of the Work, publicly display,
       publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
       Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
       License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
       such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with
       the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
       Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
       contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
       You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
       such litigation is filed.
    4. Redistribution of Work and Derivative Works. You may reproduce and
       distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
       medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
       provided that You meet the following conditions:
         1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
            Works a copy of this License; and
         2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
         3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
            You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding
            those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
            Works; and
         4. You must state in the Source Form and in the documentation of
            any Derivative Work the fact that such work is a derivation of
            the Work, and include a copy of the Work in its Source form or
            provide directions on how to obtain a copy of the Work in its
            Source form; and
         5. The Derivative Works are distributed under the terms of this
            License, or under terms that do not cause infringement of this
            License.
    5. Distribution of Embedding Works and Applications of the Work. You may
       produce and distribute any Embedding Work or Applications of the Work
       thereof in any medium, in Source or Object form, provided You meet
       the following conditions:
         1. The Embedding Works and Applications of the Work are distributed
            under the term of this License, or the application of another
            License is explicitly stated in the documentation of the
            Embedding Works and Applications of the Work or included in the
            Source form of the Embedding Works and Applications of the Work;
            and
         2. If the Source form of Embedding Works is not distributed nor
            made available to the Users in any form, the Embedding Works
            carry a prominent notice in their documentation, or when not
            applicable, in any place that the Users are exposed to, about
            the fact that the Work is embedded, along with a general
            statement about the task that the Work is performing in the
            Embedding Works; and
         3. If the Source form of Applications of the Work is not
            distributed nor made available to the Users in any form, the
            Applications of the Work carry a prominent notice in their
            documentation, or when not applicable, in any place that the
            Users are exposed to, about the fact that the Work is used by
            the Application of the Work.
    6. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
       You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
       License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
       the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
       separate license agreement You may have executed with Licensor
       regarding such Contributions.
    7. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    8. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
       to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
       provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
       OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
       without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
       NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
       License.
    9. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
       (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
       stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
       commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
       advised of the possibility of such damages.
   10. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge
       a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
       liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
       However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
       behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
       Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
       each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
       asserted against, such Contributor by reason of Your accepting any
       such warranty or additional liability.

APPENDIX: License commentary

Dear reader,

   First of all, thanks for considering using The Falcon Language for Your job, or
to embed it into Your application, or to use it for any other reason. The Falcon
Programming Language License explains what You are allowed to do with Falcon and
what You are supposed (and allowed) not to do. Since the legal jargon may be
cryptic, You are provided here with a little resume of the License. It is
important that You read and accept the License, as this resume hasn't any legal
valence, and is provided only for the reason to express clarifications and
examples that cannot find their place in the formal document.

   The License grants You the rights to use the Source code of Falcon and its
various components in any way; You can study it, You can copy it, You can modify
it, and You can even sell it, but You can't change the license under which it is
distributed: even if You sell it, You have to provide the customers with the
source code of Falcon and to grant them the same rights You have on it.

   The License also grants Your copyrights and intellectual rights for any
modification or addition You may want to apply to Falcon. In case or addition
and modifications, the License binds You to provide the user with the
information that the original program, that is Falcon, was modified by You and
what are the changes or the additions that You applied.

   Also, even if You can freely distribute, or even charge a fee, for Your derived
work, You MUST apply the Falcon Programming Language License to Your
modifications, and distribute them under the same terms. In other words, Your
modifications, if made public, must be provided or available in source code.

   The license also grants You the right to embed Falcon in any application. Here
You are granted the right to pick the terms and licenses You prefer, and to
distribute Your embedding application without providing its source code. Even if
significant portions of Falcon are in line functions, and even if You decide to
statically link Falcon in Your application, this doesn't make it a "Derivative
Work" of it: Your Embedding application is free to embed Falcon "as is" as it
wish, without any requirements in terms of source distribution. You can also
modify Falcon for Your specific needs and THEN embed Your modified version; the
modified version of Falcon is under Falcon License, and must be made available
in source code (or be proposed as a Contribution to the Falcon Committee), but
Your Embedding application can still be distributed under Your preferred terms.
The License has only a requirement that is demanded on Your Embedding
application: in case you don't distribute your embedding application isn't made
available in source code, You HAVE to state somewhere (in a place that CAN
possibly be seen by the average user) that You are embedding Falcon and the
reason for that. In example, You may state "ProgramX uses the Falcon Programming
Language to automatize the Gamma procedure".

   About the scripts, which are more or less what a scripting language is for, You
are granted the right to apply the license You prefer. As Falcon is also a
script "compiler", You may even retain from distributing the script sources, and
apply closed-source license to Your script-based application or to the scripts
that are embedded in Your embedding application. However, if You don't
distribute the script sources, and you use Falcon or another application covered
by the same license to run them, You are again required to state somewhere in
Your documentation or where the user can read it that You are using "Falcon" (or
the derivative work you used), and more or less why You are doing it. For a pure
Falcon application, You can just state "This application is written in Falcon".
In example, if You use Falcon to drive a web site, and You don't want Your site
visitors to ever see Your scripts, You have to put somewhere a reading like
"Powered with Falcon".

   What You cannot do is to claim that any thing You learnt from Falcon is Yours:
especially, You are forbidden to patent any element that is found in Falcon.
Another thing that You can't do is to sell a Falcon based product as if it were
"completely" Yours, forgetting to cite, even in a very small reading, the fact
that Falcon is in. Finally, a thing that the License prevents You from doing is
to put the blame for failures on Falcon: the product is provided as-is, without
any warranty. It's up to You to test if it is suitable to solve Your problems,
and if a Falcon based application can be sold and granted as "working" to Your
customers. If that application breaks, whether there's a problem with Falcon or
not, You can't issue any claim on the Falcon contributors.

   Finally, notice that this version of falcon is released under dual license.
You may chose either to use this FPLLv1.1 license or the standard GNU GPLv2.
GNU GPLv2 is usually shipped with Your distribution and commentaries are widely
available on the Net, so we won't discuss it here.

   Be kind on the Open Source Community: they have already made a lot for You even
if You don't know them (and even if they don't know You).


                                                         Best regards,
                                                         Giancarlo Niccolai
