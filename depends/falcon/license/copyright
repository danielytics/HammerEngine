             The Falcon Programming Language
                http://www.falconpl.org

Falcon is currently distributed under a dual licensing scheme GPL/FPLL.

The GPL licensing scheme is provided to ensure compatibilty with
Open Source and Free Software products. It's a relative strict license
which is not particularly adequate for virtual machine based scripting
languge interpreters and engines, but it can be chosen to develop
pure GPL applications or to favor integration with already
existing GPL embedding applications.

The Falcon Programming Language License is specifically designed
around the concept of an open source scripting language engine.
It grants usability of the covered source in commercial applications,
as it supports applying different and incompatible licenses to
embedding and extension elements, while ensuring the openness of
the core engine and of any work derived directly from it.

Falcon 0.8.10 and followings are released under one of GPLv2 or
FPLLv1.1, at your choice.

The GPLv2 license can be found at:

The FPLLv1.1 license can be found at:
